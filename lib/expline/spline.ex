  `Expline.Spline` is the module defining the struct and functions for
  constructing cubic splines and interpolating values along them. It is the core
  module and data structure for the library.

  ## Mathematics

  Expline uses information from the
  ["Spline interpolation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation#Algorithm_to_find_the_interpolating_cubic_spline),
  ["Cholesky decomposition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition#The_Cholesky.E2.80.93Banachiewicz_and_Cholesky.E2.80.93Crout_algorithms),
  and ["Triangular matrix"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix#Forward_and_back_substitution)
  Wikipedia pages.

  Spline interpolation requires the curvatures at the spline's given points.
  To determine the curvatures, a system of linear equations needs to be solved.

  There are a number of ways cubic splines can extrapolate values beyond their
  minimum and maximum. Currently, the only way Expline implements is "Natural
  Spline". Others, such as "Clamped Spline" and "Not-A-Knot", may be
  implemented depending on feedback from users.

  For "Natural Splines", a case of splines where the ends of the spline have no
  curvature, and are therefore can be linearly extrapolated, the matrix `X` in
  the system `Xk = y` (where the solution `k` is the vector of curvatures for
  the spline) is by definition Hermitian and positive-definite, a conclusion one
  can make by analyzing the equations and enforcing certain conditions by
  manipulating the input parameters. This allows us to generate the components
  necessary for solving for the curvatures in a more specialized fashion, and in
  the author's experience, a fairly simple fashion.

  Cholesky decomposition is a special type of Matrix decomposition that applies
  to Hermitian, positive-definite matrices. Its runtime is half of LU
  decomposition, another popular matrix decomposition.

  With the Cholesky decomposition, the procedure described
  in the first paragraph of [the "Applications" section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition#Applications)
  of the "Cholesky decomposition" Wikipedia page is used to find the
  curvatures.

  ## Performance

  Given `n` points, the algorithm for building a spline is `O(n^3)` and
  interpolating a value is `O(n)`.

  Create a spline from a list of floating point pairs (tuples).

  This function bootstraps a spline and prepares it for use in the
  `interpolate/2` function.

  If fewer than 3 points are passed to the function, the function will
  short-circuit and return `{:error, :too_few_points}`. This is a mathematical
  constraint. A cubic spline cannot be built on fewer than 3 points.

  Due to the constraints of Erlang and Elixir, there is a limit on how close
  points can be. If points are too close to each other, this leads to a
  situation where an error similar to dividing by zero occurs. In light of
  this, there is a check that occurs and short-circuits the construction of the
  spline. It returns `{:error, {:range_too_small, p1, p2}}` where `p1` and `p2`
  are two `t:point/0`s that are too close together. If this error is
  encountered, mitigating it is use-case specific. In order to find the points
  that are too close, the following snippet may prove useful:

  ```
  points
  |> Enum.group_by(fn ({x, y}) -> Float.round(x, 15) end)
  ```

  `Float.round/2` has a maximum precision of 15, and while floating point
  numbers appear to have higher precision, with representations with much
  higher points of precision, being able to reliably reconcile points is
  important.

  If this is an issue, a smaller closeness threshold will be used, but until
  then, the threshold for determining points that are too close is 1.0e-15, the
  smallest value that can't be rounded by `Float.round/2`.

  Interpolate a value from the spline.

  In regular usage, when the function is given a float and a spline, it will
  return a tuple of `{:ok, float}` corresponding to the interpolated value of
  dependent variable from the given value of the independent variable and the
  spline.

  If any of the invariants of the spline's internal representation are not
  satisfied, then `{:error, :corrupt_spline}` will be returned. If this
  happens, please report it, as that would be a sign that there is an issue with
  the underlying data structures or algorithms used in the library.
